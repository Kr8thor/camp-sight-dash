# Camp Sight Dashboard - Softened Color Scheme Update

## Overview
The Camp Sight Dashboard color scheme has been updated with softer, more comfortable variations of the Indie Campers brand colors while maintaining brand recognition.

## Color Palette Changes

### Original Indie Campers Colors
- **Blaze Orange**: `#FF5B00` (HSL: 21, 100%, 50%) - Very vibrant, high saturation
- **Brown**: `#993600` (HSL: 21, 100%, 30%) - Deep, saturated brown  
- **White**: `#FFFFFF` (HSL: 0, 0%, 100%) - Pure white

### New Softened Palette

#### Primary Colors (For Main UI Elements)
- **Soft Orange**: `HSL(21, 70%, 58%)` - Reduced saturation by 30%, increased lightness
  - Used for: Primary buttons, headers, main accent elements
  - Easier on the eyes while maintaining brand warmth
  
- **Soft Brown**: `HSL(21, 60%, 38%)` - Reduced saturation by 40%, increased lightness
  - Used for: Text headers, important labels
  - Better readability than original deep brown

#### Secondary Colors (For Large Areas)
- **Orange Soft**: `HSL(21, 50%, 65%)` - Even softer for backgrounds
- **Orange Muted**: `HSL(21, 35%, 75%)` - Very soft for large areas

- **Brown Muted**: `HSL(21, 25%, 58%)` - Very light brown for subtle accents

#### Background Colors
- **Indie Cream**: `HSL(30, 20%, 97%)` - Warm cream instead of pure white
- **Indie White**: `HSL(30, 15%, 98%)` - Slightly warmer white

## Visual Improvements

### 1. **Reduced Eye Strain**

### 2. **Better Visual Hierarchy**
- Multiple shades allow for better content organization
- Hover states use subtle transitions between color variations
- Muted colors for large areas, stronger colors for accents

### 3. **Maintained Brand Identity**
- Same hue values (21Â° orange) preserve brand recognition
- Original colors available as CSS variables for logos/special accents
- Consistent warm color temperature throughout
